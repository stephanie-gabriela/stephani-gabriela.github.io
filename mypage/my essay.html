            <p> There’s a restaurant hidden away. Disguised amongst its company in what is considered a rough neighborhood, Corona. There’s graffiti on the walls of nearby houses. There’s a board placed on the side of the restaurant, it has been there for as long as I can remember. The remnants of the ads that had previously featured front and center peek behind the newest addition. The streets have potholes and the white lines have cracked and faded. There are no traffic lights in sight, only a couple stop signs. It’s called El Cuencanito, named after a province in Ecuador. Others may be deterred by the cop cars that seem to have found a new home just around the corner, but for those that call Corona home, it’s a hidden gem. El Cuencanito has been around for as long as I have. The tables are as close together as they can be without knocking into each other. The exposed brick of the walls greets you warmly as you enter. The jukebox-like contraption in the corner of the room is old yet still kicking. Pay a dollar and you get to pick five songs. The touchscreen doesn’t register touch a majority of the time. You have to press at least three times for it to work.  As for the song selection, it has a strange mix. Traditional Ecuadorian music, of course, all the Bachata and Salsa you could ever want, Latin-pop hits and a random assortment of the Top 40 from the last decade. Hardly anyone uses it these days. Most everyone watches whatever fútbol game is on or chooses to focus on their own conversations. When you walk past, you’re guaranteed to see someone in the restaurant. It’s never empty, the same faces decorate its interior, that only adds to its familiarity.

            <p> What makes Cuencanitos what it is, what makes it special is the people. The community that established it has not left, it’s expanded and grown into Corona, Queens The mindset there is the same as the one brought over by the immigrants that founded it. To survive you do what has to be done. New York is built off the backs of immigrants. If you have to risk your life to provide from your family, then you will, and they do. Contributions and risks that are often overlooked and pushed aside in favor of discrimination. People labeled before they’re even given a chance, but they’re more than just immigrants. To the people that miss home, that miss their families, Cuencanitos serves as a bridge. The waitresses have been there for years. Their smiles haven’t faltered. Their voices are as chirpy today as they were six years ago. Their ambition hasn’t gone anywhere, the determination is still present. Despite the seemingly never-ending hours and tiring day, they feel satisfied. A job well done. The chef's work is consistent. Over the years the buildings may have changed but the food remains. A staple of our culture, a gateway home. In a city like New York, a sense of belonging will go a long way.
            </p>
            <p> A city in which every day you’re overwhelmed and change slaps you in the face. The doubt creeping in on whether you made the right choice or not. Days where you need a warmth not present in the skyscrapers that tower over you to clash against the sky.  A warmth not present in the steel that surrounds you. Find what grounds you and hold onto it. Nothing in New York can truly last forever. Soon enough the memories will be all you have to remind you of time wellspent. My place was Cuencanitos or maybe it still is. The logo is different. There’s a glass entryway now. After a decade the inevitable happened. A remodelling, a renovation, or an upgrade, but regardless of the term, a change. The place feels colder now, it no longer feels like a greeting from and old friend. The inside remains mostly the same. Minor redecorations, furniture moved around. The faces remain too. New waitresses join the old ones and it feels like I don’t fully recognize the place that has grown with me. The fútbol is still on, the food tastes the same and yet the feeling is off. The value of a place to center you remains invaluable, but it isn’t irreplaceable. It, like everything else, is subject to change.
